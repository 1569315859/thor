1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,640
I'd like to get started today we're

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,389
gonna talk about GFS the Google file

3
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:10,980
system paper we read for today

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,660
and this will be the first of a number

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,540
of different sort of case studies we'll

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,160
talk about in this course about how to

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,410
be build big storage systems so the

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:29,310
larger topic is big storage the reason

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,410
is the storage is turned out to be a key

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,260
abstraction you might you know if you

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,850
didn't know already you might imagine

12
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,230
that there could be all kinds of

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,050
different you know important

14
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,030
abstractions you might want to use for

15
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,650
distributed systems but it's turned out

16
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,730
that a simple storage interface is just

17
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,010
incredibly useful and extremely general

18
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,480
and so a lot of the thought that's gone

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,280
into building distributed systems has

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,170
either gone into designing storage

21
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,630
systems or designing other systems that

22
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,180
assume underneath them some sort of

23
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,989
reasonably well behaved big just

24
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:05,519
distributed storage system so we're

25
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,500
going to care a lot about how the you

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,360
know how to design a good interface to a

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,420
big storage system and how to design the

28
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,159
innards of the storage system so it has

29
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,030
good behavior you know of course that's

30
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,229
why we're reading this paper just to get

31
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:20,850
a start on that the this paper also

32
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,530
touches on a lot of themes that will

33
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,900
come up a lot in a tube for parallel

34
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,060
performance fault tolerance replication

35
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,740
and consistency and this paper is as

36
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,140
such things go reasonably

37
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,390
straightforward and easy to understand

38
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,670
it's also a good systems paper it sort

39
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,560
of talks about issues all the way from

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,229
the hardware to the software that

41
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,960
ultimately uses the system and it's a

42
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,320
successful real world design so it says

43
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,030
you know academic paper published in an

44
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,189
academic conference but it describes

45
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:54,890
something that really was successful and

46
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,030
used for a long time in the real world

47
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,650
so we sort of know that we're talking

48
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,340
about something that is it's a good a

49
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,110
good useful design okay so before I'm

50
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,149
gonna talk about GFS I want to sort of

51
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:11,279
talk about the space of distributed

52
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:13,030
storage systems a little bit

53
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,810
set the scene so first why is it hard

54
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,560
it's actually a lot to get right but for

55
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,900
a 2/4 there's a particular sort of

56
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,330
narrative that's gonna come up quite a

57
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:32,140
lot for many systems often the starting

58
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,180
point for people designing these sort of

59
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,890
big distributed systems or big storage

60
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,330
systems is they want to get huge

61
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,340
aggregate performance be able to harness

62
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,090
the resources of hundreds of machines in

63
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,620
order to get a huge amount of work done

64
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,000
so the sort of starting point is often

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,430
performance and you know if you start

66
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,010
there a natural next thought is well

67
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,019
we're gonna split our data over a huge

68
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:00,640
number of servers in order to be able to

69
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,420
read many servers in parallel so we're

70
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,769
gonna get and that's often called

71
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:11,160
sharding if you shard over many servers

72
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,600
hundreds or thousands of servers you're

73
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,970
just gonna see constant faults right if

74
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,140
you have thousands of servers there's

75
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,680
just always gonna be one down so we

76
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,540
the faults are just every day every hour

77
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,250
occurrences and we need automatic

78
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,350
we can't have human involved and fixing

79
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,890
this fault we need automatic

80
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:38,290
fault-tolerant systems so that leads to

81
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:43,090
fault tolerance the among the most

82
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,920
powerful ways to get fault tolerance is

83
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,630
with replication just keep two or three

84
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,190
or whatever copies of data one of them

85
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,390
fails you can use another one so we want

86
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:56,010
to have tolerance that leads to

87
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:03,100
replication if you have replication two

88
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,470
copies the data then you know for sure

89
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,329
if you're not careful they're gonna get

90
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:09,010
out of sync and so what you thought was

91
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,750
two replicas of the data where you could

92
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,549
use either one interchangeably to

93
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:14,170
tolerate faults if you're not careful

94
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,670
what you end up with is two almost

95
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,640
identical replicas of the data that's

96
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,289
like not exactly replicas at all and

97
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:22,180
what you get back depends on which one

98
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,039
you talk to so that's starting to maybe

99
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:25,240
look a little bit

100
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,420
tricky for applications to use so if we

101
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:34,330
have replication we risk weird

102
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:41,800
inconsistencies of course clever design

103
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,400
you can get rid of inconsistency and

104
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,680
make the data look very well-behaved but

105
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,450
if you do that it almost always requires

106
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,210
extra work and extra sort of chitchat

107
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,140
between all the different servers and

108
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,610
clients in the network that reduces

109
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,470
performance so if you want consistency

110
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:09,190
you pay for with low performance I which

111
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,740
is of course not what we originally

112
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,420
hoping for of course this is an absolute

113
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,650
you can build very high performance

114
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,990
systems but nevertheless there's this

115
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,480
sort of inevitable way that the design

116
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,370
of these systems play out and it results

117
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,670
in a tension between the original goals

118
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,920
of performance and the sort of

119
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,020
realization that if you want good

120
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,720
consistency you're gonna pay for it and

121
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,730
if you don't want to pay for it then you

122
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,830
have to suffer with sort of anomalous

123
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,930
behavior sometimes I'm putting this up

124
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,840
because we're gonna see this this loop

125
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,310
many times for many of the systems we

126
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,580
look we look at people are rarely

127
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,070
willing to or happy about paying the

128
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:52,930
full cost of very good consistency ok so

129
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,520
you know with brought a consistency I'll

130
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,050
talk more later in the course about more

131
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,000
exactly what I mean by good consistency

132
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
but you can think of strong consistency

133
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,280
or good consistency as being we want to

134
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,410
build a system whose behavior to

135
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,930
applications or clients looks just like

136
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,610
you'd expect from talking to a single

137
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,760
server all right we're gonna build you

138
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,260
know systems out of hundreds of machines

139
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,170
but a kind of ideal strong consistency

140
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,000
model would be what you'd get if there

141
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,560
was just one server with one copy of the

142
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,810
data doing one thing at a time so this

143
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,349
is kind of a strong

144
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:41,169
consistency kind of intuitive way to

145
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:42,789
think about strong consistency so you

146
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:45,490
might think you have one server we'll

147
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,020
assume that's a single-threaded server

148
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,210
and that it processes requests from

149
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,919
clients one at a time and that's

150
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:52,569
important because there may be lots of

151
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:55,509
clients sending concurrently requests

152
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:57,370
into the server and see some current

153
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,020
requests it picks one or the other to go

154
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,729
first and excuse that request to

155
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:04,090
completion then excuse the nets so for

156
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,099
storage servers or you know the server's

157
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:07,629
got a disk on it and what it means to

158
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:10,060
process a request is it's a write

159
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,610
request you know which might be writing

160
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,710
an item or may be increment and I mean

161
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,979
incrementing an item if it's a mutation

162
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:21,069
then we're gonna go and we have some

163
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:23,680
table of data and you know maybe index

164
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,240
by keys and values and we're gonna

165
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,039
update this table and if the request

166
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,240
comes in and to read we're just gonna

167
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,099
you know pull the write data out of the

168
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:36,759
table one of the rules here that sort of

169
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:39,580
makes this well-behaved is that each is

170
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,740
that the server really does execute in

171
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,710
our simplified model excuse to request

172
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,129
one at a time and that requests see data

173
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:49,990
that reflects all the previous

174
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,819
operations in order so if a sequence of

175
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:53,560
writes come in and the server process

176
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,360
them in some order then when you read

177
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,060
you see the sort of you know value you

178
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,009
would expect if those writes that

179
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:05,169
occurred one at a time the behavior this

180
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:07,029
is still not completely straightforward

181
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:09,659
there's some you know there's some

182
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:11,919
things that you have to spend at least a

183
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,629
second thinking about so for example if

184
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:19,539
we have a bunch of clients and client

185
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:25,180
one issues a write of value X and wants

186
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,460
it to set it to one and at the same time

187
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,460
client two issues the right of the same

188
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,159
value but wants to set it to a different

189
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,360
the same key but wants to set it to a

190
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,860
different value right

191
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,409
something happens let's say client three

192
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:42,490
reads and get some result or client

193
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,020
three after these writes complete reads

194
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,220
get some result client four

195
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,290
reads X and get some also gets a result

196
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,999
so what results should the two clients

197
00:08:51,999 --> 00:09:00,959
see yeah

198
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,200
well that's a good question so these

199
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,060
what I'm assuming here is that client

200
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,770
one inclined to launch these requests at

201
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,720
the same time so if we were monitoring

202
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,190
the network we'd see two requests

203
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,500
heading to the server at the same time

204
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,710
and then sometime later the server would

205
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,520
respond to them

206
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,790
so there's actually not enough here to

207
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,070
be able to say whether the client would

208
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,530
receipt would process the first request

209
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,780
first which order there's not enough

210
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,880
here to tell which order the server

211
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,460
processes them in and of course if it

212
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,580
processes this request first then that

213
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,760
means or it processes the right with

214
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,800
value to second and that means that

215
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,350
subsequent reads have to see two where is

216
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,030
it the server happened to process this

217
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,250
request first and this one's second that

218
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,020
means the resulting value better be one

219
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,060
and these these two requests and see one

220
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,670
so I'm just putting this up to sort

221
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,950
of illustrate that even in a simple

222
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,230
system there's ambiguity you can't

223
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,020
necessarily tell from trace of what went

224
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,190
into the server or what should come out

225
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,820
all of you can tell is that some set of

226
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,250
results is consistent or not consistent

227
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,470
with a possible execution so certainly

228
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:17,850
there's some completely wrong results we

229
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:21,060
can see go by it you know if client 3

230
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,030
sees a 2 then client 4 I bet had better

231
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:27,210
see a two also because our model is

232
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,040
well after the second write you know

233
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,750
client tree sees it two that means

234
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,870
this write must have been second and it

235
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,700
still had better be it still has to have

236
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,620
been the second write one client 4 goes

237
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,220
to the date so hopefully all this is

238
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,410
just completely straightforward and just

239
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,790
as expected because it's it's supposed

240
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,200
to be the intuitive model of strong

241
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,190
consistency ok and so the problem with

242
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,300
this of course is that a single server

243
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,370
has poor fault tolerance right if it

244
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,840
crashes or it's disk dies or something

245
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,870
we're left with nothing and so in the

246
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,520
real world of distributed systems we

247
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,430
actually build replicated systems so and

248
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,930
that's where all the problems start

249
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,220
leaking in is when we have a second

250
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,060
copying data so here is what must be

251
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,180
close to the worst replication design

252
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,220
and I'm doing this to warn you of the

253
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,810
problems that we will then be looking

254
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,960
for in GFS all right so here's a bad

255
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:30,380
replication design we're gonna have two

256
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,630
servers now each with a complete copy of

257
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:38,510
the data and so on disks that are both

258
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,730
gonna have this this table of keys and

259
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,810
values the intuition of course is that

260
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,090
we want to keep these tables we hope to

261
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,880
keep these tables identical so that if

262
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,650
one server fails we can read or write

263
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,720
from the other server and so that means

264
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,490
that somehow every write must be

265
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:59,210
processed by both servers and reads have

266
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,890
to be able to be processed by a single

267
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,570
server otherwise it's not fault tolerant

268
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,280
all right if reads have to consult both

269
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,940
and we can't survive the loss of one of

270
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:13,160
the servers okay so the problem is gonna

271
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,030
come up well I suppose we have client 1

272
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,190
and client 2 and they both want to do

273
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,570
these write say one of them gonna write

274
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,250
one and the other is going to write two

275
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,790
so client 1 is gonna launch it's write

276
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:29,270
x1 2 both because we want to update both

277
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:32,600
of them and clent 2 is gonna launch it's

278
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:41,800
write X so what's gonna go wrong here

279
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,280
yeah yeah we haven't done anything here

280
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,410
to ensure that the two servers process

281
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,590
the two requests in the same order right

282
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,930
that's a bad design

283
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:57,800
so if server 1 processes client ones

284
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,100
request first it'll end up it'll start

285
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,600
with a value of 1 and then it'll see

286
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,610
client twos request and overwrite that

287
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,610
with 2 if server 2 just happens to

288
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,350
receive the packets over the network in

289
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,020
a different order it's going to execute

290
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,310
client 2's requests and set the value to

291
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,350
2 and then then it will see client ones

292
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,140
request set the value to 1 and now what

293
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,450
a client a later reading client sees you

294
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,760
know if client 3 happens to reach from

295
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,520
this server and client for happens to

296
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,720
reach from the other server then we get

297
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,610
into this terrible situation where

298
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,320
they're gonna read different values even

299
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,410
though our intuitive model of a correct

300
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,990
service says they both subsequent reads

301
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:39,589
have to yeild the same value and this can

302
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:41,930
arise in other ways you know suppose we

303
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,579
try to fix this by making the clients

304
00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:45,920
always read from server one if it's up

305
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,829
and otherwise server two if we do that

306
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,350
then if this situation happened and four

307
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,089
why oh yeah both everybody reads might

308
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:55,279
see client might see value too but a

309
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,649
server one suddenly fails then even

310
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:00,290
though there was no right suddenly the

311
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,050
value for X we'll switch from 2 to 1

312
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,850
because if server 1 died it's all the

313
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,130
clients assistant server 2 no but just

314
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,079
this mysterious change in the data that

315
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:11,570
doesn't correspond to any right which is

316
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,190
also totally not something that could

317
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,680
have happened in this service simple

318
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:23,329
server model all right so of course this

319
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,940
can be fixed the fix requires more

320
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,220
communication usually between the

321
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:33,529
servers or somewhere more complexity and

322
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:36,649
because of the cost of inevitable cost

323
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:37,820
to the complexity to get strong

324
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,180
consistency there's a whole range of

325
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,610
different solutions to get better

326
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,769
consistency and a whole range of what

327
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:48,350
people feel is an acceptable level of

328
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:52,250
consistency in an acceptable sort of a

329
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,890
set of anomalous behaviors that might be

330
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,560
revealed all right any questions about

331
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:03,910
this disastrous model here

332
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:07,779
okay that's what you're talking about

333
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:13,209
GFS a lot of thought about doing GFS was

334
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:17,079
doing is fixing this they had better but

335
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:21,790
not perfect behavior okay so where GFS

336
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,179
came from in 2003 quite a while ago

337
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:27,730
actually at that time the the web you

338
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,379
know was certainly starting to be a very

339
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:31,569
big deal and people are building big

340
00:15:31,569 --> 00:15:35,439
websites in addition there had been

341
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:37,540
decades of research into distributed

342
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,009
systems and people sort of knew at least

343
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:40,509
at the academic level how to build all

344
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:43,119
kinds of highly parallel fault tolerant

345
00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:44,739
whatever systems but there been very

346
00:15:44,739 --> 00:15:49,589
little use of academic ideas in industry

347
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:52,239
but starting at around the time this

348
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:54,759
paper was published big websites like

349
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,399
Google started to actually build serious

350
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:01,569
distributed systems and it was like very

351
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:03,699
exciting for people like me who were on

352
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:06,879
academic side of this to see see real

353
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:10,119
uses of these ideas where Google was

354
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:11,769
coming from was you know they had some

355
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:14,470
vast vast data sets far larger than

356
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,360
could be stored in a single disk like an

357
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,769
entire crawl copy of the web or a little

358
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:22,119
bit after this paper they had giant

359
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:25,480
YouTube videos they had things like the

360
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,669
intermedia files for building a search

361
00:16:27,669 --> 00:16:28,299
index

362
00:16:28,299 --> 00:16:30,790
they also apparently kept enormous log

363
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,679
files from all their web servers so they

364
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:34,029
could later analyze them so they had

365
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:36,910
some big big data sets they used both to

366
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,339
store them and many many disks to store

367
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:41,139
them and they needed to be able to

368
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:42,399
process them quickly with things like

369
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,709
MapReduce so they needed high speed

370
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:47,529
parallel access to these vast amounts of

371
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:51,819
data okay so what they were looking for

372
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:53,669
one goal was just that the thing be big

373
00:16:53,669 --> 00:17:00,009
and fast they also wanted a file system

374
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:02,470
that was sort of global in the sense

375
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,148
that many different applications could

376
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,490
get at it one way to build a big storage

377
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,990
system is to you know you have some

378
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,398
particular application or mining you

379
00:17:09,398 --> 00:17:11,260
build storage sort of dedicated and

380
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,119
tailored to that application and if

381
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,829
somebody else in the next office needs

382
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:17,079
big storage well they can build their

383
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:17,680
own thing

384
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,099
right but if you have a universal server

385
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:25,300
kind of global reusable storage system

386
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,030
and that means that if I store a huge

387
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,710
amount of data si you know I'm crawling

388
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,600
the web and you want to look at my

389
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,290
crawled web web pages because we're all

390
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,580
using we're all playing in the same

391
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,740
sandbox we're all using the same storage

392
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,750
system you can just read my files you

393
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,480
know maybe access controls permitting so

394
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,190
the idea was to build a sort of file

395
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,110
system where anybody you know anybody

396
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:50,080
inside Google could name and read any of

397
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:57,010
the files to allow sharing in order to

398
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,540
get a in order to get bigness and

399
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,300
fastness they need to split the data

400
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:04,990
through every file will be automatically

401
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,900
split by GFS over many servers so that

402
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,950
writes and reads would just

403
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,780
automatically be fast as long as you

404
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,730
were reading from lots and lots of

405
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,770
reading a file from lots of clients you

406
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,860
get high aggregate throughput and also

407
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,230
be able to for a single file be able to

408
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,670
have single files that were bigger than

409
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,730
any single disk because we're building

410
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,170
something out of hundreds of servers we

411
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:36,430
want automatic feel your recovery we

412
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,480
don't want to build a system where every

413
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,860
time one of our hundreds of servers a

414
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,540
fail some human being has to go to the

415
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,490
machine room and do something with the

416
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,830
server or to get it up and running or

417
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,870
transfers data or something well this

418
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:50,130
isn't just fix itself um there were some

419
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:54,370
sort of non goals like one is that GFS

420
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,930
was designed to run in a single data

421
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,340
center so we're not talking about

422
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,950
placing replicas all over the world a

423
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,410
single GFS installation just lived in

424
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:05,200
one one data center one big machine run

425
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:12,190
so getting this style system to work

426
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,860
where the replicas are far distant from

427
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,550
each other is a valuable goal but

428
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:22,720
difficult so single data centers this is

429
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,540
not a service to customers GFS was for

430
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,920
internal use by

431
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,210
applications written by Google engineers

432
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,400
so it wasn't they weren't directly

433
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,810
selling this they might be selling

434
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:37,170
services they used GFS internally but

435
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,520
they weren't selling it directly so it's

436
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:45,660
just for internal use and it was

437
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,630
tailored in a number of ways for big

438
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,180
sequential file reads and writes there's

439
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,180
a whole nother domain like a system of

440
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,490
storage systems that are optimized for

441
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,590
small pieces of data like a bank that's

442
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,090
holding bank balances probably wants a

443
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,100
database that can read and write an

444
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,380
update you know 100 byte records that

445
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,230
hold people's bank balances but GFS is

446
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:10,230
not that system so it's really for big

447
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,600
or big is you know terabytes gigabytes

448
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:21,350
some big sequential not random access

449
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,690
it's also that has a certain batch

450
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,340
flavor there's not a huge amount of

451
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,840
effort to make access be very low

452
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,000
latency the focus is really on

453
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,880
throughput of big you know multi

454
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,780
megabyte operations this paper was

455
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,560
published at SOSP in 2003 the top

456
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:46,860
system's academic conference yeah usually

457
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,080
the standard for papers such conferences

458
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,260
they have you know a lot of very novel

459
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,060
research this paper was not necessarily

460
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,920
in that class the specific ideas in this

461
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,750
paper none of them are particularly new

462
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,990
at the time and things like distribution

463
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,510
and sharding and fault tolerance were

464
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:05,340
you know well understood had to had to

465
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,620
deliver those but this paper described a

466
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,480
system that was really operating in in

467
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,970
use at a far far larger scale hundreds

468
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,680
of thousands of machines much bigger

469
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,400
than any you know academics ever built

470
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,960
the fact that it was used in industry

471
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,450
and reflected real world experience of

472
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,370
like what actually didn't didn't work

473
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,490
for deployed systems that had to work

474
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:28,950
and had to be cost effective also like

475
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:34,080
extremely valuable the paper sort of

476
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,090
proposed a fairly heretical view that it

477
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,800
was okay for the storage system to have

478
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,270
pretty

479
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:45,440
consistency we the academic mindset at

480
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,550
that time was the you know the storage

481
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,780
system really should have good behavior

482
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,830
like what's the point of building

483
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,780
systems that sort of return the wrong

484
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,750
data like my terrible replication system

485
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,400
like why do that why not build systems

486
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,020
return the right data correct data

487
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,240
instead of incorrect data now with this

488
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,570
paper actually does not guarantee return

489
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:05,960
correct data and you know the hope is

490
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,130
that they take advantage of that in

491
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,440
order to get better performance I'm a

492
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,900
final thing that was sort of interesting

493
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,580
about this paper is its use of a single

494
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,370
master in a sort of academic paper you

495
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,020
probably have some fault-tolerant

496
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,900
replicated automatic failure recovering

497
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,110
master perhaps many masters with the

498
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,550
work split open um but this paper said

499
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,960
look you know you they can get away with

500
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:39,260
a single master and it worked fine well

501
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,610
cynically you know who's going to notice

502
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,010
on the web that some vote count or

503
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,920
something is wrong or if you do a search

504
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,510
on a search engine now you're gonna know

505
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:50,480
that oh you know like one of 20,000

506
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,890
items is missing from the search results

507
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:54,860
or they're in the wrong order probably

508
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,130
not so there was just much more

509
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:59,510
tolerance in these kind of systems than

510
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:02,210
there would like in a bank for incorrect

511
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:04,070
data it doesn't mean that all data and

512
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,630
websites can be wrong like if you're

513
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,880
charging people for ad impressions you

514
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,890
better get the numbers right but this is

515
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:15,830
not really about that in addition some

516
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,370
of the ways in which GFS could serve up

517
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:21,770
odd data could be compensated for in the

518
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,540
applications like where the paper says

519
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,490
you know applications should accompany

520
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:28,040
their data with checksums and clearly

521
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,260
mark record boundaries that's so the

522
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,380
applications can recover from GFS

523
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,480
serving them maybe not quite the right

524
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,690
data

525
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:44,730
all right so the general structure and

526
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:48,840
this is just figure one in the paper so

527
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,850
we have a bunch of clients hundreds

528
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,920
hundreds of clients we have one master

529
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:02,040
although there might be replicas of the

530
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:07,140
master the master keeps the mapping from

531
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,510
file names to where to find the data

532
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,980
basically although there's really two

533
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,100
tables so and then there's a bunch of

534
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:18,390
chunk servers maybe hundreds of chunk

535
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,090
servers each with perhaps one or two

536
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:23,640
discs the separation here's the master

537
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,320
is all about naming and knowing where

538
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,480
the chunks are and the chunk servers

539
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,400
store the actual data this is like a

540
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,020
nice aspect of the design that these two

541
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,760
concerns are almost completely separated

542
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,880
from each other and can be designed just

543
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:41,700
separately with separate properties the

544
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,170
master knows about all the files for

545
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,970
every file the master keeps track of a

546
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:48,260
list of chunks chunk identifiers that

547
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,880
contain the successive pieces that file

548
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,400
each chunk is 64 megabytes so if I have

549
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,090
a you know gigabyte file the master is

550
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:58,590
gonna know that maybe the first chunk is

551
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,059
stored here and the second chunk is

552
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:01,559
stored here the third chunk is stored

553
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:03,780
here and if I want to read whatever part

554
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,490
of the file I need to ask the master oh

555
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,260
which server hole is that chunk and I go

556
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,000
talk to that server and read the chunk

557
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:17,130
roughly speaking all right so more

558
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:21,150
precisely we need to turns out if we're

559
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,190
going to talk about how the system about

560
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,690
the consistency of the system and how it

561
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,360
deals with fault we need to know what

562
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,100
the master is actually storing in a

563
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,770
little bit more detail so the master

564
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:34,190
data

565
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,900
it's got two main tables that we care

566
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,360
about it's got one table that map's file

567
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:52,460
name to an array of chunk IDs or chunk

568
00:25:52,460 --> 00:26:00,830
handles this just tells you where to

569
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:03,050
find the data or what the what the

570
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:05,030
identifiers are the chunks are so it's

571
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,620
not much yet you can do with a chunk

572
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,840
identifier but the master also happens

573
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,440
to have a a second table that map's

574
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:17,570
chunk handles each chunk handle to a

575
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:21,110
bunch of data about that chunk so one is

576
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,330
the list of chunk servers that hold

577
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,900
replicas of that data each chunk is

578
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,040
stored on more than one chunk server so

579
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:39,650
it's a list of chunk servers every chunk

580
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:42,400
has a current version number so this

581
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,610
master has a remembers the version

582
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:50,150
number for each chunk all writes for a

583
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,950
chunk have to be sequence of the chunks

584
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,910
primary it's one of the replicas so

585
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:58,880
master remembers the which chunk server's

586
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,980
the primary and there's also that

587
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,570
primary is only allowed to be primary

588
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,450
for a certain lease time so the master

589
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:13,370
remembers the expiration time of the

590
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:17,240
lease this stuff so far it's all in RAM

591
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,670
and the master so just be gone if the

592
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:24,530
master crashed so in order that you'd be

593
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,570
able to reboot the master and not forget

594
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:29,150
everything about the file system the

595
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,710
master actually stores all of this data

596
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:35,180
on disk as well as in memory so reads

597
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:38,270
just come from memory but writes to at

598
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,490
least the parts of this data that had to

599
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,140
be reflected on this writes have to go

600
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,500
to the disk so and the way it actually

601
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,510
managed that is that there's all

602
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:51,290
the master has a log on disk and every

603
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:53,750
time it changes the data it appends an

604
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:59,380
entry to the log on disk and checkpoint

605
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,220
so some of this stuff actually needs to

606
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,600
be on disk and some doesn't it turns out

607
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,980
I'm guessing a little bit here but

608
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:16,190
certainly the array of chunk handles has

609
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,050
to be on disk and so I'm gonna write env

610
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:20,510
here for non-volatile meaning it it's

611
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:22,850
got to be reflected on disk the list of

612
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:25,610
chunk servers it turns out doesn't

613
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:28,370
because the master if it reboots talks

614
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,720
to all the chunk servers and ask them

615
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,710
what chunks they have so this is I

616
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:36,290
imagine not written to disk the version

617
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,450
number any guesses written to disk not

618
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:42,950
written to disk requires knowing how the

619
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:51,830
system works I'm gonna vote written to

620
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,790
disk non-volatile we can argue about

621
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,500
that later when we talk about how system

622
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:04,790
works identity the primary it turns out

623
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,560
not almost certainly not written to disk

624
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:10,640
so volatile and the reason is the master

625
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,010
is um reboots and forgets therefore

626
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:15,680
since it's volatile forgets who the

627
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,330
primary is for a chunk it can simply

628
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,910
wait for the 60-second lease expiration time

629
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,920
and then it knows that absolutely no

630
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,540
primary will be functioning for this

631
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,920
chunk and then it can designate a

632
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,020
different primary safely and similarly

633
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,660
the lease expiration stuff is volatile

634
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,840
so that means that whenever a file is

635
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,030
extended with a new chunk goes to the

636
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:40,100
next 64 megabyte boundary or the version

637
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,710
number changes because the new primary

638
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:45,740
is designated that means that the master

639
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,440
has to first append a little record to

640
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,900
his log basically saying oh I just added

641
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,510
a such-and-such a chunk to this file or

642
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:56,420
I just changed the version number so

643
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,530
every time I change is one of those that

644
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,360
needs to writes right it's disk so this

645
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,830
is paper doesn't talk about this

646
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,870
much but you know there's limits the

647
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:05,090
rate at which the master can change

648
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:07,039
things because you can only write your

649
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,340
disk however many times per second and

650
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,950
the reason for using a log rather than a

651
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:16,279
database you know some sort of b-tree or

652
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:20,179
hash table on disk is that you can

653
00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:23,980
append a log very efficiently because

654
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:26,600
you only need you can take a bunch of

655
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,309
recent log records they need to be added

656
00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:29,539
and sort of write them all on a single

657
00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:32,149
write after a single rotation to

658
00:30:32,149 --> 00:30:33,649
whatever the point in the disk is that

659
00:30:33,649 --> 00:30:36,080
contains the end of the log file whereas

660
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,899
if it were a sort of b-tree reflecting

661
00:30:38,899 --> 00:30:42,080
the real structure of this data then you

662
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,370
would have to seek to a random place in

663
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:45,169
the disk and do a little right so the

664
00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:46,519
log makes a little bit faster to write

665
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:51,620
there to reflect operations on to the

666
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:56,570
disk however if the master crashes and

667
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:58,789
has to reconstruct its state you

668
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:00,409
wouldn't want to have to reread its log

669
00:31:00,409 --> 00:31:02,570
file back starting from the beginning of

670
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,159
time from when the server was first

671
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,559
installed you know a few years ago so in

672
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,870
addition the master sometimes

673
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,940
checkpoints its complete state to disk

674
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:15,110
which takes some amount of time seconds

675
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:17,779
maybe a minute or something and then

676
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:20,210
when it restarts what it does is goes

677
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,860
back to the most recent checkpoint and

678
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,620
plays just the portion of a log that

679
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,480
sort of starting at the point in time

680
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,019
when that check one is created any

681
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:39,340
questions about the master data okay

682
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,029
so with that in mind I'm going to lay

683
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:46,340
out the steps in a read and the steps in

684
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:46,879
the right

685
00:31:46,879 --> 00:31:49,129
where all this is heading is that I then

686
00:31:49,129 --> 00:31:50,960
want to discuss you know for each

687
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,840
failure I can think of why does the

688
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,389
system or does the system act directly

689
00:31:56,389 --> 00:31:58,639
after that failure um but in order to do

690
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:00,740
that we need to understand the data and

691
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,470
operations in the data okay so if

692
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:11,210
there's a read the first step is that

693
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,980
the client and what a read means that

694
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,749
the application has a file name in mind

695
00:32:14,749 --> 00:32:17,450
and an offset in the file that it wants

696
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:19,279
to read some data front so it sends the

697
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,799
file name and the offset to the master

698
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:23,869
and the master looks up the file name in

699
00:32:23,869 --> 00:32:25,759
its file table and then you know each

700
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:28,309
chunk is 64 megabytes who can use the

701
00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:30,889
offset divided by 64 megabytes to find

702
00:32:30,889 --> 00:32:33,649
which chunk and then it looks up that

703
00:32:33,649 --> 00:32:39,409
chunk in its chunk table finds the list

704
00:32:39,409 --> 00:32:41,869
of chunk servers that have replicas of

705
00:32:41,869 --> 00:32:44,509
that data and returns that list to the

706
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:52,249
client so the first step is so you know

707
00:32:52,249 --> 00:32:56,809
the file name and the offset the master

708
00:32:56,809 --> 00:33:05,720
and the master sends the chunk handle

709
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:11,450
let's say H and the list of servers so

710
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,070
now we have some choice we can ask any

711
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,590
one of these servers pick one that's and

712
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,990
the paper says that clients try to guess

713
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,429
which server is closest to them in the

714
00:33:19,429 --> 00:33:23,360
network maybe in the same rack and send

715
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,279
the read request to that to that replica

716
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,649
the client actually caches

717
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,930
caches this result so that if it reads

718
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,820
that chunk again and indeed the client

719
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,560
might read a given chunk in you know one

720
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:45,550
megabyte pieces or 64 kilobyte pieces or

721
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,620
something so I may end up reading the

722
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,410
same chunk different points successive

723
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,730
regions of a chunk many times and so

724
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:56,050
caches which server to talk to you for

725
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,310
giving chunks so it doesn't have to keep

726
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,020
beating on the master asking the master

727
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,550
for the same information over and over

728
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:07,330
now the client talks to one of the chunk

729
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:12,880
servers tells us a chunk handling offset

730
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:16,540
and the chunk servers store these chunks

731
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:19,060
each chunk in a separate Linux file on

732
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,340
their hard drive in a ordinary Linux

733
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,699
file system and presumably the chunk

734
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:26,800
files are just named by the handle so

735
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,659
all the chunk server has to do is go

736
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:31,210
find the file with the right name you

737
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,449
know I'll give it that

738
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:35,560
entire chunk and then just read the

739
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,130
desired range of bytes out of that file

740
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:46,570
and return the data to the client I hate

741
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:51,909
question about how reads operate can I

742
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:54,370
repeat number one the step one is the

743
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:57,880
application wants to read it a

744
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,040
particular file at a particular offset

745
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,890
within the file a particular range of

746
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,420
bytes in the files and one thousand two

747
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,830
two thousand and so it just sends a name

748
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:09,010
of the file and the beginning of the

749
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:12,160
byte range to the master and then the

750
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,050
master looks a file name and it's file

751
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:18,610
table to find the chunk that contains

752
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:23,820
that byte range for that file so good

753
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:34,119
[Music]

754
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,500
so I don't know the exact details my

755
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,200
impression is that the if the

756
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,309
application wants to read more than 64

757
00:35:40,309 --> 00:35:42,319
megabytes or even just two bytes but

758
00:35:42,319 --> 00:35:44,779
spanning a chunk boundary that the

759
00:35:44,779 --> 00:35:47,869
library so the applications linked with

760
00:35:47,869 --> 00:35:52,099
a library that sends our pcs to the

761
00:35:52,099 --> 00:35:54,230
various servers and that library would

762
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,690
notice that the reads spanned a chunk

763
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:58,490
boundary and break it into two separate

764
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,039
reads and maybe talk to the master I

765
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:02,480
mean it may be that you could talk to

766
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,069
the master once and get two results or

767
00:36:04,069 --> 00:36:06,710
something but logically at least it two

768
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,269
requests to the master and then requests

769
00:36:08,269 --> 00:36:19,609
to two different chunk servers yes well

770
00:36:19,609 --> 00:36:21,650
at least initially the client doesn't

771
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:26,829
know for a given file

772
00:36:26,829 --> 00:36:35,990
what chunks need what chunks well it can

773
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,720
calculate it needs the seventeenth chunk

774
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,130
but but then it needs to know what chunk

775
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:42,109
server holds the seventeenth chunk of

776
00:36:42,109 --> 00:36:44,839
that file and for that it certainly

777
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:47,599
needs for that it needs to talk to the

778
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:58,490
master okay so all right did I'm not

779
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:59,839
going to make a strong claim about which

780
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:01,130
of them decides that it was the

781
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:03,170
seventeenth chunk in the file but it's

782
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:06,380
the master that finds the identifier of

783
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,849
the handle of the seventeenth chunk in

784
00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:09,950
the file looks that up in its table and

785
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:12,589
figures out which chunk servers hold

786
00:37:12,589 --> 00:37:17,349
that chunk yes

787
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:35,480
how does that or you mean if the if the

788
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,010
client asks for a range of bytes that

789
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:46,400
spans a chunk boundary yeah so the the

790
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,049
well you know the client will ask that

791
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:50,490
well the clients linked with this

792
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:52,950
library is a GFS library that noticed

793
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:56,190
how to take read requests apart and put

794
00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:00,270
them back together and so that library

795
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,290
would talk to the master and the master

796
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:02,910
would tell it well well you know chunk

797
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:05,130
seven is on this server and chunk eight

798
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:07,589
is on that server and then why the

799
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:09,270
library would just be able to say oh you

800
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,859
know I need the last couple bites of

801
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:12,240
chunk seven and the first couple bites

802
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,420
of chunk eight and then would fetch

803
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,819
those put them together in a buffer and

804
00:38:17,819 --> 00:38:21,980
return them to the calling application

805
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:28,530
well the master tells it about chunks

806
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,900
and the library kind of figures out

807
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,700
where it should look in a given chunk to

808
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,950
find the date of the application wanted

809
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,240
the application only thinks in terms of

810
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,609
file names and sort of just offsets in

811
00:38:38,609 --> 00:38:41,280
the entire file in the library and the

812
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,200
master conspire to turn that into chunks

813
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,500
yeah

814
00:38:50,349 --> 00:38:55,400
sorry let me get closer here you say

815
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:03,289
again so the question is does it matter

816
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:06,109
which chunk server you read from so you

817
00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:08,929
know yes and no notionally they're all

818
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:13,039
supposed to be replicas in fact as you

819
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:14,869
may have noticed or as we'll talk about

820
00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:17,209
they're not you know they're not

821
00:39:17,209 --> 00:39:20,689
necessarily identical and applications

822
00:39:20,689 --> 00:39:21,979
are supposed to be able to tolerate this

823
00:39:21,979 --> 00:39:23,779
but the fact is that you make a slightly

824
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:24,829
different data depending on which

825
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:28,999
replicas you read yeah so the paper says

826
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:32,420
that clients try to read from the chunk

827
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,699
server that's in the same rack or on the

828
00:39:34,699 --> 00:39:44,749
same switch or something all right so

829
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:47,229
that's reads

830
00:39:48,859 --> 00:39:51,420
the writes are more complex and

831
00:39:51,420 --> 00:40:02,880
interesting now the application

832
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,410
interface for writes is pretty similar

833
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:06,030
there's just some call some library you

834
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:08,910
call to make you make to the gfs client

835
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,230
library saying look here's a file name

836
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:12,540
and a range of bytes I'd like to write

837
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,339
and the buffer of data that I'd like you

838
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:17,609
to write to that that range actually let

839
00:40:17,609 --> 00:40:19,530
me let me backpedal I only want to talk

840
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:23,099
about record appends and so I'm going to

841
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:26,339
praise this the client interface as the

842
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:28,200
client makes a library call that says

843
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,940
here's a file name and I'd like to

844
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,069
append this buffer of bytes to the file

845
00:40:32,069 --> 00:40:35,099
I said this is the record appends that

846
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:42,900
the paper talks about so again the

847
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:47,579
client asks the master look I want to

848
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,680
append sends a master requesting what I

849
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,240
would like to append this named file

850
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,140
please tell me where to look for the

851
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,790
last chunk in the file because the

852
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,619
client may not know how long the file is

853
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:00,329
if lots of clients are appending the

854
00:41:00,329 --> 00:41:06,900

same file because we have some big file this logging stuff from a lot of different clients may be you know 

857
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,369
没有client必须会知道 文件有多长 因此（也不会知道）增加在哪个offset或者chunk上
no client will necessarily know how long the file is and therefore which offset or which chunk it should be appending to

860
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,280
你可以问master
so you can ask the master 

861
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:22,550
请告诉我 
please tell me about the the server's that hold the very last chunk current chunk in this file

864
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:26,040
不幸的 现在写 如果你在读
so unfortunately now the writing if you're

865
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,569
你可以从任何最新的复制读取
reading you can read from any up-to-date replica 
-
866
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:30,060
对于写 需要有一个primary
for writing though there needs to be a primary 

867
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:37,710
因此，此时文件上的primary可能已经指定，也可能没有
so at this point on the file may or may not have a primary already designated by the master

870
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,180
所以我们需要考虑
so we need to consider the case of

871
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,980
如果还没有primary
if there's no primary already 

872
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:49,560
而且master所知的 好吧 没有primary
and all the master knows well there's no primary so

873
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:53,119
一个情况是没有primary
so one case is no primary

874
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:06,339
in that case the master needs to find out the set of chunk servers that have the most up-to-date copy of the chunk

877
00:42:06,339 --> 00:42:10,660
because you know if you've been running the system for a long time 

879
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,800
due to failures or whatever 

880
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,579
there may be chunk servers out there that have old copies of the chunk from you know yesterday or last week 

882
00:42:15,579 --> 00:42:17,950
that I've been kept up to kept up to date 

883
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:21,819
because maybe that server was dead for a couple days and wasn't receiving updates 

885
00:42:21,819 --> 00:42:27,190
so there's you need to be able to tell the difference between up-to-date copies of the chunk and non up-to-date 

888
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:33,569
so the first step is to find

889
00:42:33,569 --> 00:42:37,510
you know find up-to-date 

890
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:41,319
this is all happening in the master

891
00:42:41,319 --> 00:42:42,790
because the client has asked the master 

892
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:44,260
told the master look I want up append this file

893
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,180
please tell me what chunk servers to talk to

894
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:50,680
so a part of the master trying to figure out what chunk servers the client should talk to

897
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,950
so when we finally find up-to-date replicas 

898
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:59,770
and what update means is 
- 
899
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:02,260
a replica whose version of the chunk is

900
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,720
equal to the version number that the

901
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,730
master knows is the most up-to-date version number

902
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:10,630
so the master that hands out these version numbers

904
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:14,740
the master remembers that 

905
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:18,460
oh for this particular chunk you know 

906
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:23,550
the trunk server is only up to date if it has version number 17 and this is why it has to be non-volatile stored on disk

909
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:26,560
because if if it was lost in a crash 

910
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,000
and there were chunk servers holding stale copies of chunks

911
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,140
the master wouldn't be able to distinguish between chunk

913
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,819
servers holding stale copies of a chunk from last week 

914
00:43:36,819 --> 00:43:39,310
and a chunk server that

915
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:44,440
holds the copy of the chunk that was up-to-date as of the crash 

917
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:49,470
that's why the master remembers the version number on disk yeah

919
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:59,970
if you knew you were talking to all the chunk servers 

921
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:04,660
so the observation is the master has to talk to the chunk servers anyway if it reboots 

923
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,280
in order to find which chunk server holds which chunk 

924
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,890
because the master doesn't remember that 

925
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:12,150
so you might think that

926
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:14,380
you could just take the maximum you

927
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:15,579
could just talk to the chunk servers

928
00:44:15,579 --> 00:44:17,079
find out what trunks and versions they hold 

929
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:20,619
and take the maximum for a given chunk overall the responding chunk servers

931
00:44:20,619 --> 00:44:24,579
and that would work if all the chunk servers holding a chunk responded

933
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:26,920
but the risk is that 

934
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,480
at the time the master reboots 

935
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,400
maybe some of the chunk servers are offline or disconnected or

936
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,770
whatever themselves rebooting and don't respond

937
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:35,349
and so all the master gets back

938
00:44:35,349 --> 00:44:40,119
is responses from chunk servers that have last week's copies of the block 

940
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:44,320
and the chunk servers that have the current copy haven't finished rebooting or offline or something

942
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:54,940
so ok oh yes if 

943
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:59,859
if the server's holding the most recent copy are permanently dead 

945
00:44:59,859 --> 00:45:06,540
if you've lost all copies all of the most recent version of a chunk then yes

947
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:11,130
No

948
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:15,339
okay so the question is 

949
00:45:15,339 --> 00:45:18,550
the master knows that for this chunk is looking for version 17

951
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:21,579
supposing it finds no chunk server you know

952
00:45:21,579 --> 00:45:25,780
and it talks to the chunk servers periodically to sort of ask them what chunks do you have what versions you have 

955
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:30,369
supposing it finds no server with chunk 17 with version 17 for this this chunk 

957
00:45:30,369 --> 00:45:32,800
then the master will either say

958
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,710
well either not respond yet and wait or

959
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:42,880
it will tell the client look I can't answer that try again later 

961
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,079
and this would come up like there was a power failure in the building and all the server's crashed and we're slowly rebooting 

964
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:49,510
the master might come up first

965
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:53,079
and you know some fraction of the chunk servers might be up 

967
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:57,609
and other ones would reboot five minutes from now but

968
00:45:57,609 --> 00:45:59,890
so we have to be prepared to wait 

969
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:05,440
and it will wait forever because you don't want to use a stale version of that of a chunk

971
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:12,910
okay so the master needs to assemble the list of chunk servers that have the most recent version 

974
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:14,619
the master knows the most recent versions stored on disk

975
00:46:14,619 --> 00:46:16,540
each chunk server along with each chunk

976
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,810
as you pointed out also remembers the version number of the chunk that it's stores 

978
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:25,690
so that when chunk servers reported into the master saying look I have this chunk 

981
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:27,760
the master can ignore the ones whose version does not match

982
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,339
the version the master knows is the most recent

983
00:46:30,339 --> 00:46:36,670
okay so remember we were the client want to append the master doesn't have a primary 

985
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:42,310
it figures out maybe you have to wait for the set of chunk

987
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:49,020
servers that have the most recent version of that chunk it picks a primary

989
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:56,859
so I'm gonna pick one of them to be the primary and the others to be secondary servers

992
00:46:56,859 --> 00:47:02,140
among the replicas set at the most recent version 

994
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:11,170
the master then increments the version number and writes that to disk 

996
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:13,600
so it doesn't forget it the crashes

997
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,970
and then it sends the primary in the

998
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:20,710
secondaries and that's each of them a message saying 

1000
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:22,840
look for this chunk here's the primary here's the secondaries 

1001
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:28,450
you know recipient maybe one of them and here's the new version number

1003
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:39,490
so then it tells primary secondaries this information plus the version number 

1006
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:41,920
the primaries and secondaries all write the version number to disk

1008
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,780
so they don't forget because you know 

1009
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,040
if there's a power failure or whatever 

1010
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:51,210
they have to report in to the master with the actual version number they hold yes

1012
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:06,190
that's a great question

1013
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:08,500
so I don't know 

1014
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,170
there's hints in the paper that I'm slightly wrong about this

1015
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:16,030
so the paper says I think your question was explaining something to me about the paper 

1017
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:22,480
the paper says if the master reboots and talks to chunk servers

1019
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:28,540
and one of the chunk servers reboot reports a version number that's higher than the version number the master remembers

1022
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:31,600
the master assumes that there was a failure

1023
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,600
while it was assigning a new primary and

1024
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:38,860
adopts the new the higher version number that it heard from a chunk server 

1026
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:42,250
so it must be the case that 

1027
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:48,010
in order to handle a master crash at this point that 

1028
00:48:48,010 --> 00:49:02,530
the master writes its own version number to disk after telling the primaries 

1030
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:03,550
there's a bit of a problem here though because if the

1031
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:11,880
what is that is there an ACK

1032
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:17,250
all right so maybe the master tells the

1033
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:20,400
primaries and backups and that their primaries and secondaries 

1035
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,720
if their primary secondary tells him the new version number

1036
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:27,870
waits for the ACK and then writes to disk or something unsatisfying about this 

1038
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:37,770
I don't believe that works

1039
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:40,380
because of the possibility that the

1040
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:46,650
chunk servers with the most recent version numbers being offline at the time the master reboots 

1043
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:50,610
we wouldn't want the master the master doesn't know the current version number 

1045
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:54,300
it'll just accept whatever highest version number adheres which could be an old version number 

1047
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,000
all right so this is a an area of my ignorance

1048
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,260
I don't really understand

1049
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:03,600
whether the master update its own version number on this first and then tells the primary secondary or the other way around 

1052
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,360
and I'm not sure it works either way 

1053
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:11,340
okay but in any case one way or another 

1054
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:12,810
the master update its version number 

1055
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:14,340
tells the primary secondary 

1056
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,140
look your primaries and secondaries here's a new version number

1057
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:19,410
and so now we have a primary which is able to accept writes

1059
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:23,730
that's what the primaries job is to take writes from clients and

1061
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:35,130
organize applying those writes to the various chunk servers 

1063
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:36,450
and you know the reason for the version number stuff is

1064
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:44,270
so that the master will recognize the

1065
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:49,940
which servers have this new you know the

1066
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:55,320
master hands out the ability to be primary for some chunk server 

1068
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,950
we want to be able to recognize 

1069
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:01,260
if the master crashes you know that it was that was the primary 

1070
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:05,070
that only that primary and it secondaries which were actually processed

1072
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:08,250
which were in charge of updating that chunk 

1074
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:12,630
that only those primaries and secondaries are allowed to be chunk servers in the future 

1076
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:17,270
and the way the master does this is with this version number logic

1078
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:21,500
okay so the master tells the primaries and secondaries

1079
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:24,740
that there it they're allowed to modify this block 

1081
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:29,390
it also gives the primary a lease which basically tells the primary 

1083
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:31,099
look you're allowed to be primary for the next sixty seconds 

1084
00:51:31,099 --> 00:51:33,200
after sixty Seconds you have to stop 

1085
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:39,290
and this is part of the machinery for making sure that we don't end up with two primaries

1087
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:41,869
I'll talk about a bit later 

1088
00:51:41,869 --> 00:51:46,339
okay so now we were primary 

1089
00:51:46,339 --> 00:51:50,089
now the master tells the client 

1090
00:51:50,089 --> 00:51:54,440
who the primary and the secondaries are 

1091
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:59,050
and at this point we're we're executing in

1092
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:02,240
figure two in the paper 

1093
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,040
the client now knows who the primary secondaries are 

1094
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:08,180
in some order or another and the paper explains a sort of clever way to manage this

1096
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:10,849
in some order or another 

1097
00:52:10,849 --> 00:52:15,230
the client sends a copy of the data it wants to be appended to the primary in all the secondaries 

1099
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:22,099
and the primary in the secondaries write that data to a temporary location 

1102
00:52:22,099 --> 00:52:24,380
it's not appended to the file yet 

1103
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:29,180
after they've all said yes we have the data 

1104
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,130
the client sends a message to the primary saying look 

1105
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:36,579
you know you and all the secondaries have the data I'd like to append it for this file

1108
00:52:36,579 --> 00:52:40,520
the primary maybe is receiving these requests from lots of different clients concurrently

1110
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:45,260
it picks some order execute the client request one at a time 

1112
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:48,260
and for each client appends request 

1113
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:53,030
the primary looks at the offset that's the end of the file the current end of the current chunk 

1115
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:56,480
makes sure there's enough remaining space in the chunk and 

1117
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:02,240
then tells then writes the clients record to the end of the current chunk 

1119
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:12,010
and tells all the secondaries to also write the clients data to the end to the same offset the same offset in their chunks

1122
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:20,500
all right so the primary picks an offset

1123
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:26,480
all the replicas including the primary

1124
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:36,090
are told to write the new appended record at at offset 

1126
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:38,700
the secondary's they may do it they may not

1127
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:45,480
do it I'm either run out of space maybe they crashed maybe the network message was lost from the primary 

1130
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:50,760
so if a secondary actually wrote the data to its disk at that offset 

1132
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,859
it will reply yes to the primary 

1133
00:53:52,859 --> 00:53:57,740
if the primary collects a yes answer from all of the secondaries

1134
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:08,250
so if they all of all of them managed to actually write and reply to the primary saying yes I did it 

1137
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:10,800
then the primary is going to reply reply success to the client

1138
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:21,510
if the primary doesn't get an answer from one of the secondaries 

1140
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:28,980
or the secondary reply sorry something bad happened I ran out of disk space my disk I don't know what 

1143
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:37,950
then the primary replies no to the client 

1144
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:42,000
and the paper says oh if the client gets an error like that back in the primary 
-
1146
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,020
the client is supposed to reissue the entire append sequence starting again 

1148
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:50,369
talking to the master to find out the most grease the chunk at the end of the file

1150
00:54:50,369 --> 00:54:54,300
I want to know the client supposed to reissue the whole record append operation

1152
00:54:54,300 --> 00:55:01,650
ah you would think but they don't 

1153
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:05,180
so the question is jeez you know

1154
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:08,220
the the primary tells all the replicas to do the append

1155
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:10,830
yeah maybe some of them do some of them don't right 

1157
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:14,460
if some of them don't then we apply an error to the client 

1159
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,109
so the client thinks of the append in happen

1160
00:55:16,109 --> 00:55:23,550
but those other replicas where the append succeeded they did append 

1162
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:25,400
so now we have replicas donor the same data

1163
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:31,830
one of them the one that returned in error didn't do the append 

1164
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,890
and the ones they returned yes did do the append 

1166
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:35,119
so that is just the way GFS works

1167
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:47,590
yeah so if a reader then reads this file

1168
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:50,330
they depending on what replica they be

1169
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:53,360
they may either see the appended record or they may not 

1170
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:56,810
if the record append failed

1171
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:59,120
but if the record append succeeded 

1172
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,920
if the client got a success message back

1173
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:05,420
then that means all of the replicas appended that record at the same offset

1175
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:10,160
if the client gets a no back 

1176
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:15,740
then zero or more of the replicas may have appended the record of that offset and the other ones not

1178
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:20,240
so the client got a No

1179
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:25,130
then that means that some replicas maybe some replicas have the record and some don't 

1181
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:32,980
so what you which were oughly read from you know you may or may not see the record yeah

1184
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:45,319
oh that all the replicas are the same

1185
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:47,240
all the secondaries are the same version number 

1186
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:51,500
so the version number only changes when the master assigns a new

1188
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:55,309
primary which would ordinarily happen and probably only happen if the primary failed 

1190
00:56:55,309 --> 00:56:58,270
so what we're talking about is is

1191
00:56:58,270 --> 00:57:00,200
replicas that have the fresh version number all right 
-
1192
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:08,059
and you can't tell from looking at them that they're missing that the replicas are different 

1195
00:57:08,059 --> 00:57:09,319
but maybe they're different 

1196
00:57:09,319 --> 00:57:11,390
and the justification for this is that 

1197
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:16,099
yeah you know maybe the replicas don't all have that the appended record 

1199
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:22,940
but that's the case in which the primary answer no to the clients and the client knows that the write failed 

1202
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:27,859
and the reasoning behind this is that then the client ibrary will reissue the append 

1204
00:57:27,859 --> 00:57:33,260
so the appended record will show up you know eventually the append succeed you would think 

1206
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:38,480
because the client I'll keep reissuing it until succeeds and then

1208
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,510
when it succeeds that means there's gonna be some offset you know farther on

1210
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:45,859
in the file where that record actually occurs in all the replicas as well as

1212
00:57:45,859 --> 00:57:52,690
offsets preceding that word only occurs in a few of the replicas yes

1214
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:11,779
oh this is a great question

1215
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:19,410
the exact path that the right data takes might be quite important with respect to the underlying network 

1218
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:22,950
and the paper somewhere says even though 

1219
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:24,539
when the paper first talks about it 

1220
00:58:24,539 --> 00:58:26,490
he claims that the client sends the data to each replica 

1221
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:33,539
in fact later on it changes the tune and says the client sends it to only the closest of the replicas 

1224
00:58:33,539 --> 00:58:37,829
and then the replicas then that replica forwards the data to another replica

1226
00:58:37,829 --> 00:58:39,630
along I sort of chained until all the

1227
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:43,770
replicas had the data and that path of that chain is taken to sort of minimize

1229
00:58:43,770 --> 00:59:00,390
crossing a bottleneck inter switch links in a data center yes 

1231
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:06,119
the version number only gets incremented if the master thinks there's no primary

1233
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:13,710
in the ordinary sequence there already be a primary for that chunk the the

1235
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:19,470
the the master sort of will remember oh gosh there's already a primary and secondary for that chunk and it'll just

1238
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:22,079
it won't go through this master selection it won't increment the version number 

1240
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:29,270
it'll just tell the client look up here's the primary with with no version number change

1243
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:47,090
my understanding is that if this is this

1244
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:51,050
I think you're asking a you're asking an interesting question 

1246
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:54,590
so in this scenario in which the primaries isn't answered failure to the client 

1248
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:57,860
you might think something must be wrong with something and that it should be fixed before you proceed 

1250
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:08,300
in fact as far as I can tell the paper there's no an immediate anything the client retries the append you know

1253
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:11,570
because maybe the problem was a network message got lost so there's nothing to repair right

1255
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:15,080
you know the network message got lost which should be transmitted a

1258
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:17,600
and this is sort of complicated way of retransmitting the network message

1259
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:21,020
maybe that's the most common kind of failure in that case just

1261
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:22,790
we don't change anything

1262
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:26,750
so same primary same secondaries 

1263
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:29,270
the client retries maybe this time it'll work because the network doesn't discard a message 

1265
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:31,490
it's an interesting question

1266
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:37,910
what went wrong here is that one of that there was a serious error or Fault in one of the secondaries

1269
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:46,820
what we would like is for the master to reconfigure that set of replicas to drop that secondary that's not working

1272
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:49,460
and it would then 

1273
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:50,900
because it's choosing a new primary in executing this code path 

1274
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:54,890
the master would then increment the version 

1276
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:56,750
and then we have a new primary and new working secondaries with a new version

1277
01:00:56,750 --> 01:01:04,160
and this not-so-great secondary with an old version and a stale copy of the data 
 
1280
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:09,260
but because that has an old version the master will never never mistake it for being fresh 

1282
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:12,470
but there's no evidence in the paper that that happens immediately 

1284
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:15,110
what's said in the paper 

1285
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:17,180
the client just retries and hopes it works again later

1286
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:19,610
eventually the master will 

1287
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:21,230
if the secondary is dead

1288
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:23,990
eventually the master does ping 

1289
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:25,850
all the trunk servers will realize that 

1290
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:35,590
and will probably then change the set of primaries and secondaries and increment the version but only only later

1293
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:45,660
the lease the leases that the answer to the question

1294
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:52,500
what if the master thinks the primary is dead 

1296
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,790
because it can't reach it right 

1297
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:55,470
that's supposing we're in a situation where 

1298
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:58,110
at some point the master said you're the primary 

1299
01:01:58,110 --> 01:01:59,940
and the master was like pinging them all the

1300
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:01,260
servers periodically to see if they're alive 

1301
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:02,610
because if they're dead and wants to pick a new primary 

1302
01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:05,160
the master sends some pings to you 

1303
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:09,690
you're the primary and you don't respond right 

1305
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:11,850
so you would think that at that point where gosh

1306
01:02:11,850 --> 01:02:14,060
you're not responding to my pings 

1307
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:20,790
then you might think the master at that point would designate a new primary 

1309
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:23,820
it turns out that by itself is a mistake 

1310
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:30,090
and the reason for that the reason why it's a mistake to do that simple did you know

1312
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:32,400
use that simple design is that 

1313
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,400
I may be pinging you and the reason why I'm not getting responses is because then

1315
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:38,190
there's something wrong with a network between me and you 

1317
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:41,220
so there's a possibility that you're alive you're the primary you're alive 

1319
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:42,750
I'm pining you the network is dropping that packets 

1320
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:46,320
but you can talk to other clients and you're serving requests from other clients you know 

1322
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:51,840
and if I if I the master sort of designated a new primary for that chunk

1324
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:56,340
now we'd have two primaries processing writes but two different copies of the data 

1326
01:02:56,340 --> 01:03:02,370
and so now we have totally diverging copies the data 

1328
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:12,570
and that's called that error having two primaries or whatever processing requests without knowing each other it's called split brain 

1331
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:16,710
and I'm writing this on board

1332
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:19,440
because it's an important idea and it'll come up again 

1333
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:24,540
and it's caused or it's usually said to be caused by network partition 

1335
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:35,640
that is some network error in which the master can't talk to the primary but the primary can talk to clients 

1338
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:38,330
sort of partial network failure

1339
01:03:38,330 --> 01:03:44,760
and you know these are some of the these are the hardest problems to deal with

1341
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,470
and building these kind of storage systems 

1342
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:49,170
okay so that's the problem is 

1343
01:03:49,170 --> 01:03:56,210
we want to rule out the possibility of mistakingly designating two primaries for the same chunk 

1346
01:03:56,210 --> 01:03:58,610
the way the master achieves that is that 

1347
01:03:58,610 --> 01:04:05,590
when it designates a primary it says it gives a primary a lease which is basically the right to be primary until a certain time

1350
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:12,500
the master knows it remembers and knows how long the least lasts and 

1352
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,960
the primary knows how long is lease lasts 

1353
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:20,570
if the lease expires the primary knows that it expires and will simply stop executing client requests 

1355
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:24,830
it'll ignore or reject client requests after the lease expired

1357
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:27,800
and therefore if the master can't talk to the primary

1358
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:31,220
and the master would like to designate a new primary 

1360
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:35,270
the master must wait for the lease to expire for the previous primary 

1362
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:40,010
so that means master is going to sit on its hands for one lease period 60 seconds 

1364
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:44,510
after that it's guaranteed the old primary will stop operating its primary 

1366
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:54,460
and now the master can see if he doesn't need a new primary without producing this terrible split brain situation

1369
01:05:02,299 --> 01:05:15,920
oh so the question is why is designating a new primary bad 

1371
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,079
since the clients always ask the master first and 

1372
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:20,059
so the master changes its mind 

1373
01:05:20,059 --> 01:05:22,819
then subsequent clients will direct the clients to the new primary 

1374
01:05:22,819 --> 01:05:26,390
well one reason is that the

1375
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:28,429
clients cache for efficiency the clients

1376
01:05:28,429 --> 01:05:31,279
cache the identity of the primary 

1377
01:05:31,279 --> 01:05:34,009
for at least for short periods of time 

1378
01:05:34,009 --> 01:05:37,489
even if they didn't though the bad sequence is that 

1379
01:05:37,489 --> 01:05:40,640
I'm the prime the master you ask me who the primary is 

1380
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:46,369
I send you a message saying the primary is server one right

1382
01:05:46,369 --> 01:05:47,809
and that message is inflate in the network 

1383
01:05:47,809 --> 01:05:50,630
and then I'm the master I you know 

1384
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:52,160
I think somebody's failed whatever

1385
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,269
I think that primary is filled 

1386
01:05:53,269 --> 01:05:55,219
I designated a new primary 

1387
01:05:55,219 --> 01:05:56,209
and I send the primary message saying you're the primary 

1388
01:05:56,209 --> 01:06:00,349
and I start answering other clients who ask the primary is 

1390
01:06:00,349 --> 01:06:01,400
saying that that over there is the primary

1391
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,019
while the message to you is still in flight 

1392
01:06:03,019 --> 01:06:04,880
you receive the message saying

1393
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,130
the old primaries the primary you think

1394
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:10,219
gosh I just got this from the master 

1395
01:06:10,219 --> 01:06:11,630
I'm gonna go talk to that primary 

1396
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:13,459
and without some much more clever scheme

1397
01:06:13,459 --> 01:06:14,859
there's no way you could realize that

1398
01:06:14,859 --> 01:06:19,309
even though you just got this information from the master 

1400
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:24,410
it's already out of date and if that primary serves your modification requests 

1402
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:27,920
now we have to and and respond success to you right

1403
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:35,349
then we have two conflicting replicas

1404
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:38,890
yes

1405
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:50,710
say that again you've a new file and no replicas

1406
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:55,180
okay so if you have a new file no replicas or even an existing file and no replicas 

1408
01:06:55,180 --> 01:07:00,130
the you'll take the path I drew on the blackboard 

1410
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:04,270
the master will receive a request from a client saying oh I'd like to append this file 

1412
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:08,200
and then well I guess the master will first see there's no chunks associated with that file 

1414
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:15,730
and it will just make up a new chunk identifier or perhaps by calling the random number generator 

1417
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:17,920
and then it'll look in its chunk information table and see

1418
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:22,030
gosh I don't have any information about that chunk 

1420
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:24,730
and it'll make up a new record saying but it must

1421
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:26,410
be special case code where it says well

1422
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:28,720
I don't know any version number this

1423
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,850
chunk doesn't exist I'm just gonna make

1424
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:32,740
up a new version number one 

1425
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:35,380
pick a random primary and set of secondaries

1426
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:40,660
and tell them look you are responsible for this new empty chunk please get to work

1428
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:52,710
the paper says three replicas per chunk by default so typically a primary and two backups

1431
01:08:03,930 --> 01:08:13,270
okay okay so the maybe the most

1432
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:19,890
important thing here is just to repeat the discussion we had a few minutes ago

1434
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:32,140
the intentional construction of GFS 

1435
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:33,790
we had these record appends is that 

1436
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:41,009
if we have three we have three replicas 

1437
01:08:41,009 --> 01:08:43,779
you know maybe a client sends in and a

1438
01:08:43,779 --> 01:08:46,719
record appends for record a and all three

1439
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:49,569
replicas or the primary and both of the

1440
01:08:49,569 --> 01:08:52,120
secondaries successfully append the data

1441
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:54,069
the chunks and maybe the first record in

1442
01:08:54,069 --> 01:08:55,689
the trunk might be a in that case 

1443
01:08:55,689 --> 01:08:57,930
and they all agree because they all did it

1444
01:08:57,930 --> 01:09:00,040
supposing another client comes in says

1445
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:03,339
look I want append record B 

1446
01:09:03,339 --> 01:09:06,250
but the message is lost to one of the replicas

1447
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:08,410
the network whatever supposably the

1448
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:11,589
message by mistake but the other two

1449
01:09:11,589 --> 01:09:13,390
replicas get the message and one of

1450
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:14,380
them's a primary and my other

1451
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:16,000
secondaries they both append the file

1452
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,390
so now what we have is two the replicas

1453
01:09:19,390 --> 01:09:21,759
that B and the other one doesn't have anything 

1454
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:29,109
and then may be a third client wants to append C and maybe the 

1456
01:09:29,109 --> 01:09:30,460
remember that this is the primary the primary

1457
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:32,738
picks the offset since the primary just

1458
01:09:32,738 --> 01:09:35,109
gonna tell the secondaries look in a

1459
01:09:35,109 --> 01:09:38,620
right record C at this point 

1460
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:43,450
in the chunk they all write C here 

1461
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:45,040
now the client for B the rule for a client for

1462
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,830
B that for the client that gets us error

1463
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:50,439
back from its request is that 

1464
01:09:50,439 --> 01:09:53,770
it will resend the request so now the client

1465
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:56,020
that asked to append record B will ask

1466
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:57,640
again to append record B 

1467
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:00,340
and this time maybe there's no network losses and 

1468
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:05,040
all three replicas as a panel record B

1469
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,239
right and they're all lives there they all

1470
01:10:07,239 --> 01:10:09,870
have the most fresh version number and now 

1471
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:13,150
if a client reads

1472
01:10:13,150 --> 01:10:16,830
what they see depends on the track which

1473
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:20,020
replicas they look at 

1474
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:22,929
it's gonna see in total all three of the records 

1475
01:10:22,929 --> 01:10:25,030
but it'll see in different orders depending on

1476
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:31,870
which replica reads a B C and then a repeat of B so if it

1478
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:33,730
it'll mean I'll see reads this replica it'll see B and then

1479
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:36,969
C if it reads this replica 

1480
01:10:36,969 --> 01:10:39,340
it'll see A and then a blank space in the file padding 

1481
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:41,920
and then C and then B so if you

1482
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:44,199
read here you see C then B if you read

1483
01:10:44,199 --> 01:10:47,320
here you see B and then C so different

1484
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,350
readers will see different results and

1485
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:52,330
maybe the worst situation is it 

1486
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:54,489
some client gets an error back from the primary 

1487
01:10:54,489 --> 01:10:58,360
because one of the secondaries

1488
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:00,159
failed to do the append 

1489
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:02,260
and then the client dies before we sending the request 

1490
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:04,030
so then you might get a

1491
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:07,030
situation where you have record D

1492
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:16,420
showing up in some of the replicas and completely not showing up anywhere in the other replicas 

1495
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:19,659
so you know under this scheme we have good properties for

1496
01:11:19,659 --> 01:11:23,620
for appends that the primary sent back a

1497
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:26,800
successful answer for and 

1498
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:32,949
sort of not so great properties for appends where the primary sent back of failure 

1500
01:11:32,949 --> 01:11:37,540
and the records the replicas just absolutely be different all different sets of replicas

1502
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:40,440
yes

1503
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:49,090
my reading in the paper is that the client starts at the very beginning of the process 

1505
01:11:49,090 --> 01:11:54,190
and asked the master again what's the last chunk in this file you know 

1507
01:11:54,190 --> 01:12:02,820
because it might be might have changed if other people are pending in the file yes

1510
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,290
so I can't you know I can't read the designers mind 

1511
01:12:20,290 --> 01:12:27,640
so the observation is the system could have been designed to keep the replicas in precise sync 

1514
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:30,820
it's absolutely true and you will do it in labs 2 & 3 

1515
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:36,880
so you guys are going to design a system that does replication that actually keeps the replicas in sync

1518
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:43,180
and you'll learn you know there's some various techniques various things you have to do in order to do that

1521
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:47,740
and one of them is that there just has to be this rule if you want the replicas to stay in sync 

1523
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:54,490
it has to be this rule that you can't have these partial operations that are applied to only some and not others 

1526
01:12:54,490 --> 01:12:58,630
and that means that there has to be some mechanism to like where the system 

1528
01:12:58,630 --> 01:13:01,900
even if the client dies where the system says we don't wait a minute 

1530
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:04,060
there was this operation I haven't finished it yet 

1531
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:15,360
so you build systems in which the primary actually make sure the backups get every message

1534
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:37,739
if the first write of B failed you think the C should go with the B

1536
01:13:37,770 --> 01:13:40,450
well it doesn't you may think it should

1537
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:42,130
but the way the system actually operates is that 

1538
01:13:42,130 --> 01:13:46,690
the primary will add C to the end of the chunk 

1539
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:57,730
and the after B 

1540
01:13:57,730 --> 01:13:59,890
yeah I mean one reason for this is that 

1541
01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:03,010
at the time the write for C comes in the primary may not actually know what the fate of B was

1543
01:14:03,010 --> 01:14:07,510
because we met multiple clients submitting appends concurrently

1545
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:14,890
and you know for high performance you want the primary to start the append for B first 

1547
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:21,750
and then as soon as I can got the next stop set tell everybody did you see so that all this stuff happens in parallel 

1550
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:25,270
you know by slowing it down you could 

1551
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:33,760
you know the primary could sort of decide that B it totally failed 

1553
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:39,970
and then send another round of messages saying please undo the write of B 

1555
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:43,360
and there'll be more complex and slower I'm you know

1556
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:48,730
again the the justification for this is that the design is pretty simple it you know 

1558
01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:53,820
it reveals some odd things to applications 

1559
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:58,060
and the hope was that

1560
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:04,960
applications could be relatively easily written to tolerate records being in different orders or who knows what 

1563
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:08,800
or if they couldn't that applications could

1564
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:13,300
either make their own arrangements for picking an order themselves 

1566
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,860
and writing you know sequence numbers in the files or something 

1567
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:17,739
or you could just have a 

1568
01:15:17,739 --> 01:15:20,140
if application really was very sensitive to order 

1569
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:24,220
you could just not have concurrent depends from different clients to the same file 

1571
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:27,520
right you could just you know

1572
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:29,410
close files where order is very

1573
01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:31,390
important like say it's a movie file you

1574
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:32,750
know you don't want to scramble

1575
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:35,840
bytes in a movie file you just write the Movie file 

1576
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:45,040
you write the movie to the file by one client in sequential order and not with concurrent record appends

1579
01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:56,680
okay all right

1580
01:15:56,680 --> 01:16:06,770
the somebody asked basically what would it take to turn this design into one

1582
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:08,120
which actually provided strong consistency

1583
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:18,680
consistency closer to our sort of single server model where there's no surprises 

1586
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:22,340
I don't actually know because you know that requires an entire new complex design 

1588
01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:24,560
it's not clear how to mutate GFS to be that design 

1589
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:27,440
but I can list for you lists for you some things that you would want to think about 

1591
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:34,460
if you wanted to upgrade GFS to a a system did have strong consistency

1593
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:40,940
one is that you probably need the primary to detect duplicate requests 

1595
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:44,960
so that when this second B comes in the primary is aware that 

1597
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,030
oh actually you know we already saw that request earlier

1598
01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:50,570
and did it or didn't do it and to try to

1599
01:16:50,570 --> 01:16:52,160
make sure that B doesn't show up twice in the file 

1600
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:54,140
so one is you're gonna need duplicate detection 

1601
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:59,570
another issues you probably 

1602
01:16:59,570 --> 01:17:02,660
if a secondary is acting a secondary 

1603
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:05,000
you really need to design the system 

1604
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,180
so that if the primary tells a secondary to do something

1606
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:12,560
the secondary actually does it and doesn't just return error right 

1608
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:16,880
for a strictly consistent system having the secondaries be able to just sort of blow

1610
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:24,170
off primary requests with really no compensation is not okay 

1612
01:17:24,170 --> 01:17:25,730
so I think the secondaries have to accept requests and execute them 

1613
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:32,180
or if a secondary has some sort of permanent damage like it's disk got unplugged by mistake this 

1616
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:36,200
you need to have a mechanism to like take the secondary out of the system 

1618
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:39,140
so the primary can proceed with the remaining secondaries 

1619
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:44,950
but GFS kind of doesn't either at least not right away

1621
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:49,350
and so that also means that 

1622
01:17:49,350 --> 01:17:50,910
when the primary asks secondary's to append something 

1623
01:17:50,910 --> 01:17:54,810
the secondaries have to be careful not to expose that data to readers 

1625
01:17:54,810 --> 01:18:02,610
until the primary is sure that all the secondaries really will be able to execute the append 

1628
01:18:02,610 --> 01:18:05,400
so you might need sort of multiple phases in the writes of

1629
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:06,900
first phase in which the primary asks the secondaries 

1630
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:13,560
look you know I really like you to do this operation can you do it but don't don't actually do it yet

1633
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:17,670
and if all the secondaries answer with a promise to be able to do the operation

1635
01:18:17,670 --> 01:18:22,080
only then the primary says alright everybody go ahead and do that operation you promised 

1637
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,570
and people you know that's

1638
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:27,210
the way a lot of real world systems

1639
01:18:27,210 --> 01:18:32,540
strong consistent systems work and that trick it's called two-phase commit

1641
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:34,590
another issue is that if the primary crashes 

1642
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:44,340
there will have been some last set of operations that the primary had launched started to the secondaries 

1645
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:51,660
the primary crashed before it was sure but whether those all the secondaries got there copied the operation or not 

1648
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:54,510
so if the primary crashes 

1649
01:18:54,510 --> 01:18:57,780
you know a new primary one of the secondaries is going to take over as primary 

1651
01:18:57,780 --> 01:19:05,580
but at that point the second the new primary and the remaining secondaries may differ in the last few operations 

1654
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:09,030
because maybe some of them didn't get the message before the primary crashed

1656
01:19:09,030 --> 01:19:15,300
and so the new primer has to start by explicitly resynchronizing with the secondaries to

1658
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:20,750
make sure that the sort of the tail of their operation histories are the same

1660
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:24,060
finally to deal with this problem of 

1661
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:25,530
oh you know there may be times when the secondaries differ 

1662
01:19:25,530 --> 01:19:33,000
or the client may have a slightly stale indication from the master of which secondary to talk to

1665
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:38,010
the system either needs to send all client reads through the primary 

1667
01:19:38,010 --> 01:19:43,860
because only the primary is likely to know which operations have really happened

1669
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:47,400
or we need a lease system for the secondaries just like we have for the primary 

1671
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:55,030
so that it's well understood that when secondary can or can't legally respond to a client 

1673
01:19:55,030 --> 01:19:58,570
and so these are the things I'm aware of that would have to be fixed in this system 

1675
01:19:58,570 --> 01:20:02,230
to added complexity and chitchat to make it have strong consistency 

1677
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:05,050
and you're actually the way

1678
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:08,020
I got that list was by thinking about the labs 

1679
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:12,099
you're gonna end up doing all the things I just talked about as part

1681
01:20:12,099 --> 01:20:18,940
of labs two and three to build a strictly consistent system 

1683
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:21,099
okay so let me spend one minute on there's actually

1684
01:20:21,099 --> 01:20:25,840
I have a link in the notes to a sort of retrospective interview about how well

1686
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:32,770
GFS played out over the first five or ten years of his life at Google 

1688
01:20:32,770 --> 01:20:40,570
so the high-level summary is that the most is that was tremendously successful and many many Google applications used it 

1691
01:20:40,570 --> 01:20:45,250
and a number of Google infrastructure was built as a late like big file for example BigTable 

1693
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:50,190
I mean was built as a layer on top of GFS and MapReduce also

1695
01:20:50,190 --> 01:20:54,550
so widely used within Google 

1696
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:57,460
may be the most serious limitation is that there

1697
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:59,289
was a single master and the master had

1698
01:20:59,289 --> 01:21:01,510
to have a table entry for every file in every chunk 

1699
01:21:01,510 --> 01:21:06,820
and that mean does the GFS use grew and they're about more and more files 

1701
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:11,980
the master just ran out of memory ran out of RAM to store the files and

1703
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:18,309
you know you can put more RAM on but there's limits to how much RAM a single machine can have and so 

1706
01:21:18,309 --> 01:21:19,599
that was the most of the most immediate problem people ran into

1707
01:21:19,599 --> 01:21:28,030
in addition the load on a single master from thousands of clients started to be too much 

1710
01:21:28,030 --> 01:21:30,940
in the master only the cpu can only process however many hundreds of requests per second

1712
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:39,880
especially the write 01:21:33,070 --> 01:21:35,739
things to disk and pretty soon there got to be too many clients 

1715
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:44,260
another problem with a some applications found it hard to deal with this kind of 

1717
01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:47,500
sort of odd semantics and a final problem is that

1718
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:52,059
the master that was not an automatic story for master failover

1720
01:21:52,059 --> 01:21:54,400
in the original in the GFS paper as we read it 

1721
01:21:54,400 --> 01:22:00,460
like required human intervention to deal with a master that had sort of permanently crashed and needs to be replaced 

1724
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:09,360
and that could take tens of minutes or more I was just too long for failure recovery for some applications

1727
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:13,630
okay excellent I'll see you on Thursday

1728
01:22:13,630 --> 00:00:00,000
and we'll hear more about all these themes over the semester
